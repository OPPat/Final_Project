Here are the new implementation for this week's assignment:

1. CSS styling using an external style sheet
   For this purpose, a css file (styles.css) containing the style rules is included along with the rest
   of the html pages.

2. In a limited number of cases, internal styling was resorted to, but even in those cases, the inline style
   referenced the external style sheet styles.css.

3. Addtional semantic html elements were added to those of last week using such tags as <figure>, <figcaption>, <main> in response to the facilitator's suggestions.

4.The css selectors used include but not limited to the selectors representing the corresponding html tags such as

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <body>, <header>, <footer> etc. Also included are selectors such as ids and classes.
 
5. Media queries were utilised to account for breakpoints for 5 distinct differences in how the pages are presented based on the screen size  even though 3 was required.
