This website is mainly biographical and briefly introduces one to my profile and is a fulfilment of the
CS601 final project.

My name is Patounezambo Ouedraogo, currently pursuing a Masters and Software development
at Boston University.

The website contains a total of ten (10) pages not including the readme.md, the css files, javascript files as well as an
image and video directories. Here are the pages:

| Page name       | Page description                         |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| About_me.html   | Describes who I am and where I come from |
| Education.html  | Page shows my education                  |
| My beliefs.html | This page shows my religious beliefs     |
| My Hobbies.html | This page presents my hobbies            |
| Work.html       | this page shows where I work/worked      |
| Readme.md       | this is the current page                 |

styles.css This page contains the css rules used to
style the the html pages. |
| myResume.html My Resume
Index.html Welcome page|  
 degrees.html My earned and pursued degrees
ContactMe.html contact form|
Here are the new implementation for this week's assignment:

1. CSS styling using an external style sheet
   For this purpose, a css file (styles.css) containing the style rules is included along with the rest
   of the html pages.

2. In a limited number of cases, internal styling was resorted to, but even in those cases, the inline style
   referenced the external style sheet styles.css.

3. Addtional semantic html elements were added to those of last week using such tags as <figure>, <figcaption>, <main> in response to the facilitator's suggestions.

4.The css selectors used include but not limited to the selectors representing the corresponding html tags such as

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <body>, <header>, <footer> etc. Also included are selectors such as ids and classes.
 
5. Media queries were utilised to account for breakpoints for 5 distinct differences in how the pages are presented based on the screen size  even though 3 was required.

6. I tried to have my navigation bar to be sticky as the facilitator advised, but didn't succeed even after using the
   "position" property with a value of "sticky". This, I thought would have ensured that the navigation links would still
   be visible even as the pages are scrolled down or up. At last, as a solution, I added a naviation bar in two places, to make it available both at the top and at the bottom, but I'd appreciate it if you could show me how to use css declaration to have the navigation always visible regardless of page movement.
