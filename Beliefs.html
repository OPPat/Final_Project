<h2>My beliefs</h2>
<h3>Born and raised a Christian</h3>
<p>I grew up in a loving christian family. Dad and mom would take my brothers and I
every week to church; and so from a young age I developed a love for church. This eventually led to
my later interest in the study of theology.</p>

<p>Through Church services, reading the Bible from a young age and my theological course of study,I learned that God created the world
and our first parents, Adam and Eve, in the book of Genesis. Then I learned that because of sin
we are all doomed for eternal loss since, according to the Bible, the wages of sin is death.
Thankfully, that's not our final fate since God made a way. He decided to take that death
upon Himself in the person of Jesus-Christ. Now anyone can be saved if they'd believe in Jesus
and accept the free salvation that He offers.</p>
