<p> My name is Patounezambo Ouedraogo. But most people call me Philippe,
    which is the name I've chosen for myself. I was born in <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso">Burkina-Faso</a> , a country in
    western Africa. It's a beautiful landlocked country with its people renown for their
    hospitality. Burkina-<br>Faso is 105900 square miles in area with an estimated population
    of 21500000 people, per the 2020 census.

    I grew up in the countryside until age 13 when I first moved to the city continue my
    secondary education in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koudougou"> Koudougou</a>, the third-largest city.<br> At 16, I transferred to the capital,
    Ouagadougou, where  I pursued and  completed my secondary education.
    Then, I took on a job as an evangelist <br> following a brief period of training and served in that position
    for four years. Following that service, I left my country for Cameroon to study <br>theology at the end of which
    I came to the United States, working in various capacities such as missionary, educator
    and currently as a student <br>again at Boston University.
