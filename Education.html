        My educational journey took me through two continents and three countries.<br>
        I did my kindergarten years through secondary school in my beautiful home country, Burkina-Faso.<br> Then,
        went to college in Cameroon for my undergraduate studies in Theology. Next, I just completed <br>a Masters of Science
        degree in Education from Pace University in New York, and am currently pursuing<br> a Masters of Software Development from Boston University.

        <h4>Pace University</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://www.pace.edu/"> Pace University</a> is a private University having its main campus right at the end of the Brooklyn Bridge in<br>New York City. It was convenient to attend Pace given that I live nearby. However, being able to attend<br>
        Boston University remotely means that any location advantage that Pace University had is now non-existent.</p>
