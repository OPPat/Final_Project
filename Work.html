        <h2>Teacher</h2>
<p>
    I worked as a New York City public school teacher until recently, notably March 2022.
    Teaching during the covid 19 outbreak since 2020 has tested the grip and commitment of many a one
    in the teaching world, just as it did in the healthcare sector. Still, it presented great
    opportunities as it led to educational stakeholders further developing and enhancing additional
    tools to keep teaching and to maximize student learning.
</p>
<p>
    Personally, I enjoyed introducing new remote/digital teaching platforms to my students. Applications
    such as Edpuzzle, Nearpod, Paddlet, quizzlet, etc, helped make remote teaching via Zoom meetings or Microsoft
    Teams meetings a fun experience for my students.
